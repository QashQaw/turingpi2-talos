# Turingpi2 with talos Kubernetes Cluster
I've been waiting a long time for the RK1 card to arrive, so that I had plenty of time to prepare my thoughts on this. Started out with only 1CM4 Pi4 Card - so not that much to prepare - But when only Unbuntu and talos imagesa are prepared for the RK1. Never the less - I do not like ubuntu on such small PC's - so talos is my choice. But I cannot take the credit for all the works others have done.
